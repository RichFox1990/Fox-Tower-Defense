TO DO LIST:

Bottom bar status (time, money, wave, next wave etc)
- decide if you build tower from this bar or another side bar
** partly implemented - build towers and HUD info moved down

- change timers to ensure they dont continue if game is paused

use image for the tower upgrading
** decide on button style **done
- make tech tree/ level limits for towers (dict, variables etc)
- consider using JSON?

Direct fire towers
- archer, magic **archer done**
- edit/add the shooting functions for it (add variable to towers to track the type of fire)

flying mobs
- direct fire can only attack these
- leave normal rect at shadow, add second draw rect with value of y addded to appear flying
- also add slight "wobble"  (-5,+5)

use a game function to calculate what mobs are within tower radius, pass this list to 
the towers instead of the towers iterating through the whole list each

tidy up main update of mobs, towers, main
- delte obselete functions and rewrite/ condesnse some (srface_buttons etc)
